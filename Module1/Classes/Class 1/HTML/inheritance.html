            The concept of inheritance is quite straightforward to understand. It has everything to do with <em>parent</em> and <em>child</em> classes.

        <p>
            As said in abstraction, in Java we can only extend a single parent class to a child class. This is known as <em>multiple inheritance</em> and it is actually a bad practice and it makes no sense to do something like this in the vast majority of cases. In Python this can be achieved but as mentioned, it is bad practice and not worth implementing.
