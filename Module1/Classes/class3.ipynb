    "One very important aspect of dealing with class variables is accesing these variables via instances or classes. In the code above it is not possible to modify `raiseAmount` by doing `employee1.raiseAmount = 1.25`. This is because this way would be creating a new attribute to an object of class `Employee` (just like the attributes that are defined in the `__init__` method) rather than changing its value. The proper way to modify the value is using the *class*, hence `Employee.raiseAmount = 1.25`\n",
