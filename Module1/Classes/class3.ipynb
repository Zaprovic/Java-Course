    "In the code above we define a class named `Employee`. Of course there will be some attributes corresponding toa specific Employee object but, it makes sense that the raise amount can be treated as a global variable, in this case, a class variable. `raiseAmount` will be apply to be 15% to every instance of the class `Employee`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also the variable `numberEmployees` is a class variable. Note that is being updated in the `__init__` method. Remember that whenever creating an instance of a class **the `__init__` method is always called**, which allows to update the number of employees every time a new one is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "One very important aspect of dealing with class variables is accesing these variables via instances or classes. In the code above it is not possible to modify `raiseAmount` by doing `employee1.raiseAmount = 1.25`. This is because this way would be creating a new attribute to an object of class `Employee` (just like the attributes that are defined in the `__init__` method) rather than changing its value. The proper way to modify the value is using the *class*, hence `Employee.raiseAmount = 1.25`\n",
