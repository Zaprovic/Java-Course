    "# **<span style=\"color:brown\">Inheritance in Java</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a very fundamental concept in Java. It promotes code reusability and it is applied when there are enough similar features between a set of classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance relationship is set from a *parents class* to *child classes*. The parent class is independent from everything, and any changes to the child classes will not affect the parent in any form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Child classes inherit everything from the parent class, including methods, fields and constructors. However, depending on the way the child class methods and fields are defined, they may or may not have access to some inherited elements. In a child class these elements can also be overriden.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java the structure to define inheritance is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "        public class ParentClass{\n",
    "\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        public class ChildClass1 extends ParentClass{\n",
    "            \n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        public class ChildClass2 extends ParentClass{\n",
    "\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        public class ChildClass3 extends ParentClass{\n",
    "\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to realise is that Java **does not accept multiple inheritance**. This means that a child class cannot extend two parent classes at the same time. This does not happen with interfaces. A child class, or any class in general, can implement as many interfaces as needed, but can only extend one parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a sneaky way to achieve multiple inheritance in Java. Consider the following example\n",
    "\n",
    "        public class Object{\n",
    "\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        public class A extends Object{\n",
    "\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        public class B extends A{\n",
    "\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "The parent class is `Object`, and the class `A` extends `Object` (it is a child class). So `A` is type `Object`. On the other hand, the class `B` extends `A`, so it is type `A` and `Object` at the same time, hence, it can have acces to the elements both classes at the same time.\n",

    "# **<span style=\"color:brown\">Polymorphism</span>**\n",
    "This concept has to do with the abiliity of a class to identify an overriden method, and be capable of make the different implementations the method has, according to which class is being executed\n",
    "\n",
    "## **<span style=\"color:pink\">Type conversion (casting) </span>**\n",
    "In java, type conversion or casting can be achieved implicitly or explicitly. An implicit type conversion does not requiere to specify the datatype that wants to be converted to, while explicit conversion does.\n",
    "\n",
    "        public class Person{}\n",
    "\n",
    "        class Employee extends Persona{}\n",
    "\n",
    "        class Manager extends Employee{}\n",

    "                public static void main(String[] args){\n",
    "                        Person p1,p2;\n",
    "                        Employee e1,e2;\n",
    "                        Manager m1,m2;\n",
    "\n",
    "                        //Implicit conversion\n",
    "                        p1 = e2; //Employee to Person\n",
    "                        p2 = m2; //Manager to Person\n",
    "                        e1 = m2; //Manager to Employee\n",
    "\n",
    "                        //Explicit conversion\n",
    "                        m1 = p2; //Person to Manager (This will yield error)\n",
    "                        m1 = (Manager) p2; //Person to Manager (By explicit casting)\n",
    "                        m1 = (Manager) p1; //Person to Manager (This will yield error)\n",
    "                        \n",
    "                }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Manager` can be of type `Employee` or `Person` because of the way it is inheriting the classes by multiple inheritance. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, `Person` cannot be of type `Manager`, because it is the parent class, so it does not inherit from anything. But a `Person` dataype can be of class `Manager` if and only if it is a type `Manager` or a child class of it. That is why the casting `(Manager)` works, because implicitly `p2` was assigned to be of type `Manager` in the line of code that says `p2 = m2`.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, implicit casting is achieved when the right-hand side reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is a *subclass* of the left-hand size reference\n",
    "- Points to an object of the same class or subclass of itself\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit casting is achieved when the right-hand side reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is a *superclass* of the left-hand side reference\n",
    "- Points to an object of the same class or subclass of the right\n",
